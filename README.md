### Introduction
Analytical solutions for computing stress of rotating disk are already exist in literature. However, the solutions are varied according to the authors. Besides, each of them is specified for a kind of thickness profile; and most of them are assumed to be axisymmetric. These limitations make the implementation and development become difficult. The purpose of this project is to use FEM technique to solve this problem in the most general case, make a python package and publish it code freely. <br>
